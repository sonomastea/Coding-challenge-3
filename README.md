This assigments purpose is to create a code that can implement a car class and consructor that can show the accelerated speed of a car class or the declerated speed when the car brakes. 
This is done using a accelerate and brake function which is then put to test data from a BMW and Mercedes. We then test each of these methods by calling each a multitude of times to see if there is functionality. 
This project provides a lot of good practice for Java script knowledge expansion.
