//Car Class Implementation Challenge
//Step 1 
//Implement a car class with a constructor that that initializes the make and speed properties 
class car{
    constructor(make,speed){
    this.make= make;
    this.speed= speed;
    }
}

const carOne = new car(BMW,120 km/h)
const carTwo = new car(Mercedes,95 km/h)
 console.log(carOne);
 console.log(carTwo);

 //Step 2
 //Implement an accelerate method in the car class that increases the car's speed and logs the new speed to the console
function calcTip(car){this.speed(+10); return 'the $${make} accelerated to $${speed}'.}
